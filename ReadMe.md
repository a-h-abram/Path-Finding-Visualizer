# Path Finding Algorithms

## Soft Description
Web app which shows how different path finding algorithms work thanks to a homemade graphical interface.  


**There is 2 path finding algorithms available :**
- A* (also called A Star)
- Dijkstra

## Technical Description
- Language: Node.js  
- Framework : Express
- Graphical Interface (chart bars) : Homemade (canvas of HTML5)

#### What will be my next project ?

Maybe a web app which shows how different path finding algorithms work (A*, Dijkstra), 
it could be great to implement more features like "Uber Pool algorithm", etc ;)
